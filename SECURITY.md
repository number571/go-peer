# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

During updates, some features may become incompatible with previously existing versions. Therefore, it is assumed that only the latest version of the project will be supported. This behavior allows you to respond more quickly to vulnerabilities and problems found in the code.

If a problem is found and such a problem becomes critical, a new version of the project with a modified version will be released. For example, if the previous version was v1.5.26, then during the update it will become v1.5.27. In other words, the patch number part will increase.

Most of the project updates are related to patch versions. The minor version, in turn, is updated solely based on considerations of stability of all functions during manual testing. Thus, patch versions are directly related to fixing problems and creating new functionality, while minor versions are related to standardizing everything created in patch versions.

You can find out more about all the changes made during the correction or update of the project in the file CHANGELOG.md.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerability, or another problem has been found in the project, then you can report it in the [Issue](https://github.com/number571/go-peer/issues/new). If you are using the program code and found a bug in it, then you can also leave a [Pull Request](https://github.com/number571/go-peer/pulls) with the fixed problem.
